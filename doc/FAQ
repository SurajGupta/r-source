2 R Basics
**********

2.1 What is R?
==============

R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists of a
language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to
certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script
files.

   The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S (*note What is S?::) and Sussman's Scheme
(http://www.cs.indiana.edu/scheme-repository/home.html).  Whereas the
resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying
implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.  *Note What are the
differences between R and S?::, for further details.

   The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows branching
and looping as well as modular programming using functions.  Most of the
user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is possible for the user
to interface to procedures written in the C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for
efficiency.  The R distribution contains functionality for a large number
of statistical procedures.  Among these are: linear and generalized linear
models, nonlinear regression models, time series analysis, classical
parametric and nonparametric tests, clustering and smoothing.  There is
also a large set of functions which provide a flexible graphical
environment for creating various kinds of data presentations.  Additional
modules ("add-on packages") are available for a variety of specific
purposes (*note R Add-On Packages::).

   R was initially written by Ross Ihaka <Ross.Ihaka@R-project.org> and
Robert Gentleman <Robert.Gentleman@R-project.org> at the Department of
Statistics of the University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand.  In
addition, a large group of individuals has contributed to R by sending code
and bug reports.

   Since mid-1997 there has been a core group (the "R Core Team") who can
modify the R source code archive.  The group currently consists of Doug
Bates, John Chambers, Peter Dalgaard, Robert Gentleman, Kurt Hornik,
Stefano Iacus, Ross Ihaka, Friedrich Leisch, Thomas Lumley, Martin
Maechler, Duncan Murdoch, Paul Murrell, Martyn Plummer, Brian Ripley,
Duncan Temple Lang, Luke Tierney, and Simon Urbanek.

   R has a home page at `http://www.R-project.org/'.  It is free software
(http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) distributed under a GNU-style
copyleft (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html), and an official part
of the GNU (http://www.gnu.org/) project ("GNU S").

2.2 What machines does R run on?
================================

R is being developed for the Unix, Windows and Mac families of operating
systems.  Support for Mac OS Classic ended with R 1.7.1.

   The current version of R will configure and build under a number of
common Unix platforms including CPU-linux-gnu for the i386, alpha, arm,
hppa, ia64, m68k, mips/mipsel, powerpc, s390, sparc (e.g.,
`http://buildd.debian.org/build.php?&pkg=r-base'), and x86_64 CPUs,
powerpc-apple-darwin, mips-sgi-irix, rs6000-ibm-aix, and sparc-sun-solaris.

   If you know about other platforms, please drop us a note.

2.3 What is the current version of R?
=====================================

The current released version is 2.7.2.  Based on this
`major.minor.patchlevel' numbering scheme, there are two development
versions of R, a patched version of the current release (`r-patched') and
one working towards the next minor or eventually major (`r-devel') releases
of R, respectively.  Version r-patched is for bug fixes mostly.  New
features are typically introduced in r-devel.

2.4 How can R be obtained?
==========================

Sources, binaries and documentation for R can be obtained via CRAN, the
"Comprehensive R Archive Network" (see *Note What is CRAN?::).

   Sources are also available via `https://svn.R-project.org/R/', the R
Subversion repository, but currently not via anonymous rsync (nor CVS).

   Tarballs with daily snapshots of the r-devel and r-patched development
versions of R can be found at `ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/Software/R'.

2.5 How can R be installed?
===========================

2.5.1 How can R be installed (Unix)
-----------------------------------

If R is already installed, it can be started by typing `R' at the shell
prompt (of course, provided that the executable is in your path).

   If binaries are available for your platform (see *Note Are there Unix
binaries for R?::), you can use these, following the instructions that come
with them.

   Otherwise, you can compile and install R yourself, which can be done
very easily under a number of common Unix platforms (see *Note What
machines does R run on?::).  The file `INSTALL' that comes with the R
distribution contains a brief introduction, and the "R Installation and
Administration" guide (*note What documentation exists for R?::) has full
details.

   Note that you need a FORTRAN compiler or perhaps `f2c' in addition to a
C compiler to build R.  Also, you need Perl version 5 to build the R object
documentations.  (If this is not available on your system, you can obtain a
PDF version of the object reference manual via CRAN.)

   In the simplest case, untar the R source code, change to the directory
thus created, and issue the following commands (at the shell prompt):

     $ ./configure
     $ make

   If these commands execute successfully, the R binary and a shell script
front-end called `R' are created and copied to the `bin' directory.  You
can copy the script to a place where users can invoke it, for example to
`/usr/local/bin'.  In addition, plain text help pages as well as HTML and
LaTeX versions of the documentation are built.

   Use `make dvi' to create DVI versions of the R manuals, such as
`refman.dvi' (an R object reference index) and `R-exts.dvi', the "R
Extension Writers Guide", in the `doc/manual' subdirectory.  These files
can be previewed and printed using standard programs such as `xdvi' and
`dvips'.  You can also use `make pdf' to build PDF (Portable Document
Format) version of the manuals, and view these using e.g. Acrobat.  Manuals
written in the GNU Texinfo system can also be converted to info files
suitable for reading online with Emacs or stand-alone GNU Info; use `make
info' to create these versions (note that this requires Makeinfo version
4.5).

   Finally, use `make check' to find out whether your R system works
correctly.

   You can also perform a "system-wide" installation using `make install'.
By default, this will install to the following directories:

`${prefix}/bin'
     the front-end shell script

`${prefix}/man/man1'
     the man page

`${prefix}/lib/R'
     all the rest (libraries, on-line help system, ...).  This is the "R
     Home Directory" (`R_HOME') of the installed system.

In the above, `prefix' is determined during configuration (typically
`/usr/local') and can be set by running `configure' with the option

     $ ./configure --prefix=/where/you/want/R/to/go

(E.g., the R executable will then be installed into
`/where/you/want/R/to/go/bin'.)

   To install DVI, info and PDF versions of the manuals, use `make
install-dvi', `make install-info' and `make install-pdf', respectively.

2.5.2 How can R be installed (Windows)
--------------------------------------

The `bin/windows' directory of a CRAN site contains binaries for a base
distribution and a large number of add-on packages from CRAN to run on
Windows 2000 and later (including 64-bit versions of Windows) on ix86 and
x86_64 chips. The Windows version of R was created by Robert Gentleman and
Guido Masarotto, and is now being developed and maintained by Duncan
Murdoch <murdoch@stats.uwo.ca> and Brian D. Ripley
<Brian.Ripley@R-project.org>.

   For most installations the Windows installer program will be the easiest
tool to use.

   See the "R for Windows FAQ"
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html) for more details.

2.5.3 How can R be installed (Macintosh)
----------------------------------------

The `bin/macosx' directory of a CRAN site contains a standard Apple
installer package inside a disk image named `R.dmg'.  Once downloaded and
executed, the installer will install the current non-developer release of
R.  RAqua is a native Mac OS X Darwin version of R with a R.app Mac OS X
GUI.  Inside `bin/macosx/powerpc/contrib/X.Y' there are prebuilt binary
packages (for powerpc version of Mac OS X) to be used with RAqua
corresponding to the "X.Y" release of R. The installation of these packages
is available through the "Package" menu of the R.app GUI.  This port of R
for Mac OS X is maintained by Stefano Iacus <Stefano.Iacus@R-project.org>.
The "R for Mac OS X FAQ
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html) has more details.

   The `bin/macos' directory of a CRAN site contains bin-hexed (`hqx') and
stuffit (`sit') archives for a base distribution and a large number of
add-on packages of R 1.7.1 to run under Mac OS 8.6 to Mac OS 9.2.2.  This
port of R for Macintosh is no longer supported.

2.6 Are there Unix binaries for R?
==================================

The `bin/linux' directory of a CRAN site contains the following packages.

               CPU           Versions                    Provider
     --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
     Debian    i386/amd64    stable/oldstable            Johannes Ranke
     Red Hat   i386/x86_64   fedora7/fedora8             Martyn Plummer
               i386/x86_64   el4/el5                     Bob Kinney
     SuSE      i586/x86_64   10.0/10.1/10.2/10.3         Detlef Steuer
     Ubuntu    i386          dapper/feisty/gutsy/hardy   Vincent Goulet
               amd64         dapper/feisty/gutsy/hardy   Michael Rutter

   Debian packages, maintained by Dirk Eddelbuettel and Doug Bates, have
long been part of the Debian distribution, and can be accessed through APT,
the Debian package maintenance tool.  Use e.g. `apt-get install r-base
r-recommended' to install the R environment and recommended packages.  If
you also want to build R packages from source, also run `apt-get install
r-base-dev' to obtain the additional tools required for this.  So-called
"backports" of the current R packages for the "stable" distribution of
Debian are provided by Johannes Ranke, and available from CRAN.  Simply add
the line

     deb http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/linux/debian stable/

(feel free to use a CRAN mirror instead of the master) to the file
`/etc/apt/sources.list', and install as usual.  More details on installing
and administering R on Debian Linux can be found at
`http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/linux/debian/README'.  These backports
should also be suitable for other Debian derivatives.  Native backports for
Ubuntu are provided by Vincent Goulet and Michael Rutter.

   On SUSE, you can set up an installation source for R within Yast by
setting (e.g.)

     Protocol: HTTP
     Server name: software.openSUSE.org
     Directory: /download/home:/dsteuer/openSUSE_10.2/

   With this setting, online updates will check for new versions of R.

   The `bin/solaris' directory of a CRAN site contains binary packages for
Solaris on the SPARC and x64 platforms, provided by Mithun Sridharan.

   No other binary distributions are currently publically available via
CRAN.

   A "live" Linux distribution with a particular focus on R is "Quantian",
which provides a directly bootable and self-configuring "Live DVD"
containing numerous applications of interests to scientists and
researchers, including several hundred CRAN and Bioconductor packages, the
"ESS" extensions for Emacs, the "JGR" Java GUI for R, the Ggobi
visualization tool as well as several other R interfaces. The "Quantian"
website at `http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/' contains more details as
well download information.

2.7 What documentation exists for R?
====================================

Online documentation for most of the functions and variables in R exists,
and can be printed on-screen by typing `help(NAME)' (or `?NAME') at the R
prompt, where NAME is the name of the topic help is sought for.  (In the
case of unary and binary operators and control-flow special forms, the name
may need to be be quoted.)

   This documentation can also be made available as one reference manual
for on-line reading in HTML and PDF formats, and as hardcopy via LaTeX, see
*Note How can R be installed?::.  An up-to-date HTML version is always
available for web browsing at `http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/'.

   Printed copies of the R reference manual for some version(s) are
available from Network Theory Ltd, at
`http://www.network-theory.co.uk/R/base/'.  For each set of manuals sold,
the publisher donates USD 10 to the R Foundation (*note What is the R
Foundation?::).

   The R distribution also comes with the following manuals.

   * "An Introduction to R" (`R-intro') includes information on data types,
     programming elements, statistical modeling and graphics.  This
     document is based on the "Notes on S-PLUS" by Bill Venables and David
     Smith.

   * "Writing R Extensions" (`R-exts') currently describes the process of
     creating R add-on packages, writing R documentation, R's system and
     foreign language interfaces, and the R API.

   * "R Data Import/Export" (`R-data') is a guide to importing and
     exporting data to and from R.

   * "The R Language Definition" (`R-lang'), a first version of the
     "Kernighan & Ritchie of R", explains evaluation, parsing, object
     oriented programming, computing on the language, and so forth.

   * "R Installation and Administration" (`R-admin').

   * "R Internals" (`R-ints') is a guide to R's internal structures.
     (Added in R 2.4.0.)

2.9 What mailing lists exist for R?
===================================

Thanks to Martin Maechler <Martin.Maechler@R-project.org>, there are four
mailing lists devoted to R.

`R-announce'
     A moderated list for major announcements about the development of R and
     the availability of new code.

`R-packages'
     A moderated list for announcements on the availability of new or
     enhanced contributed packages.

`R-help'
     The `main' R mailing list, for discussion about problems and solutions
     using R, announcements (not covered by `R-announce' and `R-packages')
     about the development of R and the availability of new code.

`R-devel'
     This list is for questions and discussion about code development in R.

Please read the posting guide (http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html)
_before_ sending anything to any mailing list.

   Note in particular that R-help is intended to be comprehensible to
people who want to use R to solve problems but who are not necessarily
interested in or knowledgeable about programming.  Questions likely to
prompt discussion unintelligible to non-programmers (e.g., questions
involving C or C++) should go to R-devel.

   Convenient access to information on these lists, subscription, and
archives is provided by the web interface at
`http://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/'.  One can also subscribe (or
unsubscribe) via email, e.g. to R-help by sending `subscribe' (or
`unsubscribe') in the _body_ of the message (not in the subject!) to
<R-help-request@lists.R-project.org>.

   Send email to <R-help@lists.R-project.org> to send a message to everyone
on the R-help mailing list.  Subscription and posting to the other lists is
done analogously, with `R-help' replaced by `R-announce', `R-packages', and
`R-devel', respectively.  Note that the R-announce and R-packages lists are
gatewayed into R-help.  Hence, you should subscribe to either of them only
in case you are not subscribed to R-help.

   It is recommended that you send mail to R-help rather than only to the R
Core developers (who are also subscribed to the list, of course).  This may
save them precious time they can use for constantly improving R, and will
typically also result in much quicker feedback for yourself.

   Of course, in the case of bug reports it would be very helpful to have
code which reliably reproduces the problem.  Also, make sure that you
include information on the system and version of R being used.  See *Note R
Bugs:: for more details.

2.11 Can I use R for commercial purposes?
=========================================

R is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  If you have any
questions regarding the legality of using R in any particular situation you
should bring it up with your legal counsel.  We are in no position to offer
legal advice.

   It is the opinion of the R Core Team that one can use R for commercial
purposes (e.g., in business or in consulting).  The GPL, like all Open
Source licenses, permits all and any use of the package.  It only restricts
distribution of R or of other programs containing code from R.  This is
made clear in clause 6 ("No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor") of
the Open Source Definition (http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.html):

     The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in
     a specific field of endeavor.  For example, it may not restrict the
     program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic
     research.

It is also explicitly stated in clause 0 of the GPL, which says in part

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
     covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
     running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
     is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program.

   Most add-on packages, including all recommended ones, also explicitly
allow commercial use in this way.  A few packages are restricted to
"non-commercial use"; you should contact the author to clarify whether
these may be used or seek the advice of your legal counsel.

   None of the discussion in this section constitutes legal advice.  The R
Core Team does not provide legal advice under any circumstances.

2.12 Why is R named R?
======================

The name is partly based on the (first) names of the first two R authors
(Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka), and partly a play on the name of the
Bell Labs language `S' (*note What is S?::).

2.13 What is the R Foundation?
==============================

The R Foundation is a not for profit organization working in the public
interest.  It was founded by the members of the R Core Team in order to
provide support for the R project and other innovations in statistical
computing, provide a reference point for individuals, institutions or
commercial enterprises that want to support or interact with the R
development community, and to hold and administer the copyright of R
software and documentation.  See `http://www.R-project.org/foundation/' for
more information.

3 R and S
*********

3.1 What is S?
==============

S is a very high level language and an environment for data analysis and
graphics.  In 1998, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) presented
its Software System Award to John M. Chambers, the principal designer of S,
for

     the S system, which has forever altered the way people analyze,
     visualize, and manipulate data ...

     S is an elegant, widely accepted, and enduring software system, with
     conceptual integrity, thanks to the insight, taste, and effort of John
     Chambers.

   The evolution of the S language is characterized by four books by John
Chambers and coauthors, which are also the primary references for S.

   * Richard A. Becker and John M. Chambers (1984), "S.  An Interactive
     Environment for Data Analysis and Graphics," Monterey: Wadsworth and
     Brooks/Cole.

     This is also referred to as the "_Brown Book_", and of historical
     interest only.

   * Richard A. Becker, John M. Chambers and Allan R. Wilks (1988), "The New
     S Language," London: Chapman & Hall.

     This book is often called the "_Blue Book_", and introduced what is
     now known as S version 2.

   * John M. Chambers and Trevor J. Hastie (1992), "Statistical Models in
     S,"  London: Chapman & Hall.

     This is also called the "_White Book_", and introduced S version 3,
     which added structures to facilitate statistical modeling in S.

   * John M. Chambers (1998), "Programming with Data," New York: Springer,
     ISBN 0-387-98503-4
     (`http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/departments/sia/Sbook/').

     This "_Green Book_" describes version 4 of S, a major revision of S
     designed by John Chambers to improve its usefulness at every stage of
     the programming process.

   See `http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/departments/sia/S/history.html' for
further information on "Stages in the Evolution of S".

   There is a huge amount of user-contributed code for S, available at the
S Repository (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/S/) at CMU.

3.2 What is S-PLUS?
===================

S-PLUS is a value-added version of S sold by Insightful Corporation.  Based
on the S language, S-PLUS provides functionality in a wide variety of
areas, including robust regression, modern non-parametric regression, time
series, survival analysis, multivariate analysis, classical statistical
tests, quality control, and graphics drivers.  Add-on modules add
additional capabilities.

   See the Insightful S-PLUS page
(http://www.insightful.com/products/splus/) for further information.

3.3 What are the differences between R and S?
=============================================

We can regard S as a language with three current implementations or
"engines", the "old S engine" (S version 3; S-PLUS 3.x and 4.x), the "new S
engine" (S version 4; S-PLUS 5.x and above), and R.  Given this
understanding, asking for "the differences between R and S" really amounts
to asking for the specifics of the R implementation of the S language,
i.e., the difference between the R and S _engines_.

   For the remainder of this section, "S" refers to the S engines and not
the S language.

3.3.1 Lexical scoping
---------------------

Contrary to other implementations of the S language, R has adopted an
evaluation model in which nested function definitions are lexically scoped.
This is analogous to the evalutation model in Scheme.

   This difference becomes manifest when _free_ variables occur in a
function.  Free variables are those which are neither formal parameters
(occurring in the argument list of the function) nor local variables
(created by assigning to them in the body of the function).  In S, the
values of free variables are determined by a set of global variables
(similar to C, there is only local and global scope).  In R, they are
determined by the environment in which the function was created.

   Consider the following function:

     cube <- function(n) {
       sq <- function() n * n
       n * sq()
     }

   Under S, `sq()' does not "know" about the variable `n' unless it is
defined globally:

     S> cube(2)
     Error in sq():  Object "n" not found
     Dumped
     S> n <- 3
     S> cube(2)
     [1] 18

   In R, the "environment" created when `cube()' was invoked is also looked
in:

     R> cube(2)
     [1] 8

   As a more "interesting" real-world problem, suppose you want to write a
function which returns the density function of the r-th order statistic
from a sample of size n from a (continuous) distribution.  For simplicity,
we shall use both the cdf and pdf of the distribution as explicit
arguments.  (Example compiled from various postings by Luke Tierney.)

   The S-PLUS documentation for `call()' basically suggests the following:

     dorder <- function(n, r, pfun, dfun) {
       f <- function(x) NULL
       con <- round(exp(lgamma(n + 1) - lgamma(r) - lgamma(n - r + 1)))
       PF <- call(substitute(pfun), as.name("x"))
       DF <- call(substitute(dfun), as.name("x"))
       f[[length(f)]] <-
         call("*", con,
              call("*", call("^", PF, r - 1),
                   call("*", call("^", call("-", 1, PF), n - r),
                        DF)))
       f
     }

Rather tricky, isn't it?  The code uses the fact that in S, functions are
just lists of special mode with the function body as the last argument, and
hence does not work in R (one could make the idea work, though).

   A version which makes heavy use of `substitute()' and seems to work
under both S and R is

     dorder <- function(n, r, pfun, dfun) {
       con <- round(exp(lgamma(n + 1) - lgamma(r) - lgamma(n - r + 1)))
       eval(substitute(function(x) K * PF(x)^a * (1 - PF(x))^b * DF(x),
                       list(PF = substitute(pfun), DF = substitute(dfun),
                            a = r - 1, b = n - r, K = con)))
     }

(the `eval()' is not needed in S).

   However, in R there is a much easier solution:

     dorder <- function(n, r, pfun, dfun) {
       con <- round(exp(lgamma(n + 1) - lgamma(r) - lgamma(n - r + 1)))
       function(x) {
         con * pfun(x)^(r - 1) * (1 - pfun(x))^(n - r) * dfun(x)
       }
     }

This seems to be the "natural" implementation, and it works because the
free variables in the returned function can be looked up in the defining
environment (this is lexical scope).

   Note that what you really need is the function _closure_, i.e., the body
along with all variable bindings needed for evaluating it.  Since in the
above version, the free variables in the value function are not modified,
you can actually use it in S as well if you abstract out the closure
operation into a function `MC()' (for "make closure"):

     dorder <- function(n, r, pfun, dfun) {
       con <- round(exp(lgamma(n + 1) - lgamma(r) - lgamma(n - r + 1)))
       MC(function(x) {
            con * pfun(x)^(r - 1) * (1 - pfun(x))^(n - r) * dfun(x)
          },
          list(con = con, pfun = pfun, dfun = dfun, r = r, n = n))
     }

   Given the appropriate definitions of the closure operator, this works in
both R and S, and is much "cleaner" than a substitute/eval solution (or one
which overrules the default scoping rules by using explicit access to
evaluation frames, as is of course possible in both R and S).

   For R, `MC()' simply is

     MC <- function(f, env) f

(lexical scope!), a version for S is

     MC <- function(f, env = NULL) {
       env <- as.list(env)
       if (mode(f) != "function")
         stop(paste("not a function:", f))
       if (length(env) > 0 && any(names(env) == ""))
         stop(paste("not all arguments are named:", env))
       fargs <- if(length(f) > 1) f[1:(length(f) - 1)] else NULL
       fargs <- c(fargs, env)
       if (any(duplicated(names(fargs))))
         stop(paste("duplicated arguments:", paste(names(fargs)),
              collapse = ", "))
       fbody <- f[length(f)]
       cf <- c(fargs, fbody)
       mode(cf) <- "function"
       return(cf)
     }

   Similarly, most optimization (or zero-finding) routines need some
arguments to be optimized over and have other parameters that depend on the
data but are fixed with respect to optimization.  With R scoping rules,
this is a trivial problem; simply make up the function with the required
definitions in the same environment and scoping takes care of it.  With S,
one solution is to add an extra parameter to the function and to the
optimizer to pass in these extras, which however can only work if the
optimizer supports this.

   Nested lexically scoped functions allow using function closures and
maintaining local state.  A simple example (taken from Abelson and Sussman)
is obtained by typing `demo("scoping")' at the R prompt.  Further
information is provided in the standard R reference "R: A Language for Data
Analysis and Graphics" (*note What documentation exists for R?::) and in
Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka (2000), "Lexical Scope and Statistical
Computing", _Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics_, *9*,
491-508.

   Nested lexically scoped functions also imply a further major difference.
Whereas S stores all objects as separate files in a directory somewhere
(usually `.Data' under the current directory), R does not.  All objects in
R are stored internally.  When R is started up it grabs a piece of memory
and uses it to store the objects.  R performs its own memory management of
this piece of memory, growing and shrinking its size as needed.  Having
everything in memory is necessary because it is not really possible to
externally maintain all relevant "environments" of symbol/value pairs.
This difference also seems to make R _faster_ than S.

   The down side is that if R crashes you will lose all the work for the
current session.  Saving and restoring the memory "images" (the functions
and data stored in R's internal memory at any time) can be a bit slow,
especially if they are big.  In S this does not happen, because everything
is saved in disk files and if you crash nothing is likely to happen to
them.  (In fact, one might conjecture that the S developers felt that the
price of changing their approach to persistent storage just to accommodate
lexical scope was far too expensive.)  Hence, when doing important work,
you might consider saving often (see *Note How can I save my workspace?::)
to safeguard against possible crashes.  Other possibilities are logging
your sessions, or have your R commands stored in text files which can be
read in using `source()'.

     Note: If you run R from within Emacs (see *Note R and Emacs::), you
     can save the contents of the interaction buffer to a file and
     conveniently manipulate it using `ess-transcript-mode', as well as
     save source copies of all functions and data used.

3.3.2 Models
------------

There are some differences in the modeling code, such as

   * Whereas in S, you would use `lm(y ~ x^3)' to regress `y' on `x^3', in
     R, you have to insulate powers of numeric vectors (using `I()'), i.e.,
     you have to use `lm(y ~ I(x^3))'.

   * The glm family objects are implemented differently in R and S.  The
     same functionality is available but the components have different
     names.

   * Option `na.action' is set to `"na.omit"' by default in R, but not set
     in S.

   * Terms objects are stored differently.  In S a terms object is an
     expression with attributes, in R it is a formula with attributes.  The
     attributes have the same names but are mostly stored differently.

   * Finally, in R `y ~ x + 0' is an alternative to `y ~ x - 1' for
     specifying a model with no intercept.  Models with no parameters at all
     can be specified by `y ~ 0'.

3.3.3 Others
------------

Apart from lexical scoping and its implications, R follows the S language
definition in the Blue and White Books as much as possible, and hence
really is an "implementation" of S.  There are some intentional differences
where the behavior of S is considered "not clean".  In general, the
rationale is that R should help you detect programming errors, while at the
same time being as compatible as possible with S.

   Some known differences are the following.

   * In R, if `x' is a list, then `x[i] <- NULL' and `x[[i]] <- NULL'
     remove the specified elements from `x'.  The first of these is
     incompatible with S, where it is a no-op.  (Note that you can set
     elements to `NULL' using `x[i] <- list(NULL)'.)

   * In S, the functions named `.First' and `.Last' in the `.Data'
     directory can be used for customizing, as they are executed at the
     very beginning and end of a session, respectively.

     In R, the startup mechanism is as follows.  Unless `--no-environ' was
     given on the command line, R searches for site and user files to
     process for setting environment variables.  Then, R searches for a
     site-wide startup profile unless the command line option
     `--no-site-file' was given.  This code is loaded in package *base*.
     Then, unless `--no-init-file' was given, R searches for a user profile
     file, and sources it into the user workspace.  It then loads a saved
     image of the user workspace from `.RData' in case there is one (unless
     `--no-restore-data' or `--no-restore' were specified).  Next, a
     function `.First()' is run if found on the search path.  Finally,
     function `.First.sys' in the *base* package is run.  When terminating
     an R session, by default a function `.Last' is run if found on the
     search path, followed by `.Last.sys'.  If needed, the functions
     `.First()' and `.Last()' should be defined in the appropriate startup
     profiles.  See the help pages for `.First' and `.Last' for more
     details.

   * In R, `T' and `F' are just variables being set to `TRUE' and `FALSE',
     respectively, but are not reserved words as in S and hence can be
     overwritten by the user.  (This helps e.g. when you have factors with
     levels `"T"' or `"F"'.)  Hence, when writing code you should always
     use `TRUE' and `FALSE'.

   * In R, `dyn.load()' can only load _shared objects_, as created for
     example by `R CMD SHLIB'.

   * In R, `attach()' currently only works for lists and data frames, but
     not for directories.  (In fact, `attach()' also works for R data files
     created with `save()', which is analogous to attaching directories in
     S.)  Also, you cannot attach at position 1.

   * Categories do not exist in R, and never will as they are deprecated now
     in S.  Use factors instead.

   * In R, `For()' loops are not necessary and hence not supported.

   * In R, `assign()' uses the argument `envir=' rather than `where=' as in
     S.

   * The random number generators are different, and the seeds have
     different length.

   * R passes integer objects to C as `int *' rather than `long *' as in S.

   * R has no single precision storage mode.  However, as of version 0.65.1,
     there is a single precision interface to C/FORTRAN subroutines.

   * By default, `ls()' returns the names of the objects in the current
     (under R) and global (under S) environment, respectively.  For example,
     given

          x <- 1; fun <- function() {y <- 1; ls()}

     then `fun()' returns `"y"' in R and `"x"' (together with the rest of
     the global environment) in S.

   * R allows for zero-extent matrices (and arrays, i.e., some elements of
     the `dim' attribute vector can be 0).  This has been determined a
     useful feature as it helps reducing the need for special-case tests for
     empty subsets.  For example, if `x' is a matrix, `x[, FALSE]' is not
     `NULL' but a "matrix" with 0 columns.  Hence, such objects need to be
     tested for by checking whether their `length()' is zero (which works
     in both R and S), and not using `is.null()'.

   * Named vectors are considered vectors in R but not in S (e.g.,
     `is.vector(c(a = 1:3))' returns `FALSE' in S and `TRUE' in R).

   * Data frames are not considered as matrices in R (i.e., if `DF' is a
     data frame, then `is.matrix(DF)' returns `FALSE' in R and `TRUE' in S).

   * R by default uses treatment contrasts in the unordered case, whereas S
     uses the Helmert ones.  This is a deliberate difference reflecting the
     opinion that treatment contrasts are more natural.

   * In R, the argument of a replacement function which corresponds to the
     right hand side must be named `value'.  E.g., `f(a) <- b' is evaluated
     as `a <- "f<-"(a, value = b)'.  S always takes the last argument,
     irrespective of its name.

   * In S, `substitute()' searches for names for substitution in the given
     expression in three places: the actual and the default arguments of
     the matching call, and the local frame (in that order).  R looks in
     the local frame only, with the special rule to use a "promise" if a
     variable is not evaluated.  Since the local frame is initialized with
     the actual arguments or the default expressions, this is usually
     equivalent to S, until assignment takes place.

   * In S, the index variable in a `for()' loop is local to the inside of
     the loop.  In R it is local to the environment where the `for()'
     statement is executed.

   * In S, `tapply(simplify=TRUE)' returns a vector where R returns a
     one-dimensional array (which can have named dimnames).

   * In S(-PLUS) the C locale is used, whereas in R the current operating
     system locale is used for determining which characters are
     alphanumeric and how they are sorted.  This affects the set of valid
     names for R objects (for example accented chars may be allowed in R)
     and ordering in sorts and comparisons (such as whether `"aA" < "Bb"' is
     true or false).  From version 1.2.0 the locale can be (re-)set in R by
     the `Sys.setlocale()' function.

   * In S, `missing(ARG)' remains `TRUE' if ARG is subsequently modified;
     in R it doesn't.

   * From R version 1.3.0, `data.frame' strips `I()' when creating (column)
     names.

   * In R, the string `"NA"' is not treated as a missing value in a
     character variable.  Use `as.character(NA)' to create a missing
     character value.

   * R disallows repeated formal arguments in function calls.

   * In S, `dump()', `dput()' and `deparse()' are essentially different
     interfaces to the same code.  In R from version 2.0.0, this is only
     true if the same `control' argument is used, but by default it is not.
     By default `dump()' tries to write code that will evaluate to
     reproduce the object, whereas `dput()' and `deparse()' default to
     options for producing deparsed code that is readable.

   * In R, indexing a vector, matrix, array or data frame with `[' using a
     character vector index looks only for exact matches (whereas `[[' and
     `$' allow partial matches).  In S, `[' allows partial matches.

   * S has a two-argument version of `atan' and no `atan2'.  A call in S
     such as `atan(x1, x2)' is equivalent to R's `atan2(x1, x2)'.  However,
     beware of named arguments since S's `atan(x = a, y = b)' is equivalent
     to R's `atan2(y = a, x = b)' with the meanings of `x' and `y'
     interchanged.  (R used to have undocumented support for a two-argument
     `atan' with positional arguments, but this has been withdrawn to avoid
     further confusion.)

   * Numeric constants with no fractional and exponent (i.e., only integer)
     part are taken as integer in S-PLUS 6.x or later, but as double in R.


   There are also differences which are not intentional, and result from
missing or incorrect code in R.  The developers would appreciate hearing
about any deficiencies you may find (in a written report fully documenting
the difference as you see it).  Of course, it would be useful if you were
to implement the change yourself and make sure it works.

3.4 Is there anything R can do that S-PLUS cannot?
==================================================

Since almost anything you can do in R has source code that you could port
to S-PLUS with little effort there will never be much you can do in R that
you couldn't do in S-PLUS if you wanted to.  (Note that using lexical
scoping may simplify matters considerably, though.)

   R offers several graphics features that S-PLUS does not, such as finer
handling of line types, more convenient color handling (via palettes),
gamma correction for color, and, most importantly, mathematical annotation
in plot texts, via input expressions reminiscent of TeX constructs.  See
the help page for `plotmath', which features an impressive on-line example.
More details can be found in Paul Murrell and Ross Ihaka (2000), "An
Approach to Providing Mathematical Annotation in Plots", _Journal of
Computational and Graphical Statistics_, *9*, 582-599.

3.5 What is R-plus?
===================

For a very long time, there was no such thing.

   XLSolutions Corporation (http://www.xlsolutions-corp.com/) is currently
beta testing a commercially supported version of R named R+ (read R plus).

   In addition, REvolution Computing (http://www.revolution-computing.com/)
has released RPro (http://www.revolution-computing.com/rpro.html), an
enterprise-class statistical analysis system based on R, suitable for
deployment in professional, commercial and regulated environments.

   Random Technologies (http://www.random-technologies-llc.com/) offers
RStat (http://random-technologies-llc.com/products/RStat/rstat), an
enterprise-strength statistical computing environment which combines R with
enterprise-level validation, documentation, software support, and
consulting services, as well as related R-based products.

4 R Web Interfaces
******************

*Rweb* is developed and maintained by Jeff Banfield
<jeff@math.montana.edu>.  The Rweb Home Page
(http://www.math.montana.edu/Rweb/) provides access to all three versions
of Rweb--a simple text entry form that returns output and graphs, a more
sophisticated Javascript version that provides a multiple window
environment, and a set of point and click modules that are useful for
introductory statistics courses and require no knowledge of the R language.
All of the Rweb versions can analyze Web accessible datasets if a URL is
provided.

   The paper "Rweb: Web-based Statistical Analysis", providing a detailed
explanation of the different versions of Rweb and an overview of how Rweb
works, was published in the Journal of Statistical Software
(`http://www.jstatsoft.org/v04/i01/').

   Ulf Bartel <ulfi@cs.tu-berlin.de> has developed *R-Online*, a simple
on-line programming environment for R which intends to make the first steps
in statistical programming with R (especially with time series) as easy as
possible.  There is no need for a local installation since the only
requirement for the user is a JavaScript capable browser.  See
`http://osvisions.com/r-online/' for more information.

   *Rcgi* is a CGI WWW interface to R by MJ Ray <mjr@dsl.pipex.com>.  It
had the ability to use "embedded code": you could mix user input and code,
allowing the HTML author to do anything from load in data sets to enter
most of the commands for users without writing CGI scripts.  Graphical
output was possible in PostScript or GIF formats and the executed code was
presented to the user for revision.  However, it is not clear if the
project is still active.  Currently, a modified version of *Rcgi* by Mai
Zhou <mai@ms.uky.edu> (actually, two versions: one with (bitmap) graphics
and one without) as well as the original code are available from
`http://www.ms.uky.edu/~statweb/'.

   CGI-based web access to R is also provided at
`http://hermes.sdu.dk/cgi-bin/go/'.  There are many additional examples of
web interfaces to R which basically allow to submit R code to a remote
server, see for example the collection of links available from
`http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/StatCompCourse'.

   David Firth (http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/dfirth) has written *CGIwithR*,
an R add-on package available from CRAN.  It provides some simple
extensions to R to facilitate running R scripts through the CGI interface
to a web server, and allows submission of data using both GET and POST
methods.  It is easily installed using Apache under Linux and in principle
should run on any platform that supports R and a web server provided that
the installer has the necessary security permissions.  David's paper
"CGIwithR: Facilities for Processing Web Forms Using R" was published in
the Journal of Statistical Software (`http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i10/').
The package is now maintained by Duncan Temple Lang
<duncan@wald.ucdavis.edu> and has a web page at
`http://www.omegahat.org/CGIwithR/'.

   Rpad (http://www.rpad.org/Rpad), developed and actively maintained by
Tom Short, provides a sophisticated environment which combines some of the
features of the previous approaches with quite a bit of Javascript,
allowing for a GUI-like behavior (with sortable tables, clickable graphics,
editable output), etc.

   Jeff Horner is working on the R/Apache Integration Project which embeds
the R interpreter inside Apache 2 (and beyond).  A tutorial and
presentation are available from the project web page at
`http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/RApacheProject'.

   Rserve (http://stats.math.uni-augsburg.de/Rserve/) is a project actively
developed by Simon Urbanek.  It implements a TCP/IP server which allows
other programs to use facilities of R.  Clients are available from the web
site for Java and C++ (and could be written for other languages that
support TCP/IP sockets).

   OpenStatServer (http://openstatserver.org/index.html) is being developed
by a team lead by Greg Warnes; it aims "to provide clean access to
computational modules defined in a variety of computational environments
(R, SAS, Matlab, etc) via a single well-defined client interface" and to
turn computational services into web services.

   Two projects use PHP to provide a web interface to R.  R_PHP_Online
(http://steve-chen.net/R_PHP/) by Steve Chen (though it is unclear if this
project is still active) is somewhat similar to the above Rcgi and Rweb.
R-php (http://dssm.unipa.it/R-php/?cmd=home) is actively developed by
Alfredo Pontillo and Angelo Mineo and provides both a web interface to R
and a set of pre-specified analyses that need no R code input.

   webbioc (http://www.bioconductor.org/) is "an integrated web interface
for doing microarray analysis using several of the Bioconductor packages"
and is designed to be installed at local sites as a shared computing
resource.

   Finally, Rwui (http://rwui.cryst.bbk.ac.uk) is a web application to to
create user-friendly web interfaces for R scripts.  All code for the web
interface is created automatically.  There is no need for the user to do
any extra scripting or learn any new scripting techniques.

   Some CRAN packages that do not build out of the box on Windows, require
additional software, or are shipping third party libraries for Windows
cannot be made available on CRAN in form of a Windows binary packages.
Nevertheless, some of these packages are available at the "CRAN extras"
repository at `http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/RWin/' kindly provided by
Brian D. Ripley.  Note that this repository is a default repository for
recent versions of R for Windows.

   There used to be a CRAN `src/contrib/Devel' directory with packages
still "under development" or depending on features only present in the
current development versions of R.  This area is no longer provided, with
packages formerly in this area either in the regular package area or the
archive `src/contrib/Archive'.

5.1.5 Other add-on packages
---------------------------

Jim Lindsey <jlindsey@gen.unimaas.nl> has written a collection of R
packages for nonlinear regression and repeated measurements, consisting of
*event* (event history procedures and models), *gnlm* (generalized
nonlinear regression models), *growth* (multivariate normal and
elliptically-contoured repeated measurements models), *repeated*
(non-normal repeated measurements models), *rmutil* (utilities for
nonlinear regression and repeated measurements), and *stable* (probability
functions and generalized regression models for stable distributions).  All
analyses in the new edition of his book "Models for Repeated Measurements"
(1999, Oxford University Press) were carried out using these packages.  Jim
has also started *dna*, a package with procedures for the analysis of DNA
sequences.  Jim's packages can be obtained from
`http://popgen.unimaas.nl/~jlindsey/rcode.html'.

   More code has been posted to the R-help mailing list, and can be
obtained from the mailing list archive.

5.2 How can add-on packages be installed?
=========================================

(Unix only.)  The add-on packages on CRAN come as gzipped tar files named
`PKG_VERSION.tar.gz', which may in fact be "bundles" containing more than
one package.  Provided that `tar' and `gzip' are available on your system,
type

     $ R CMD INSTALL /path/to/PKG_VERSION.tar.gz

at the shell prompt to install to the library tree rooted at the first
directory in your library search path (see the help page for `.libPaths()'
for details on how the search path is determined).

   To install to another tree (e.g., your private one), use

     $ R CMD INSTALL -l LIB /path/to/PKG_VERSION.tar.gz

where LIB gives the path to the library tree to install to.

   Even more conveniently, you can install and automatically update
packages from within R if you have access to repositories such as CRAN.
See the help page for `available.packages()' for more information.

5.3 How can add-on packages be used?
====================================

To find out which additional packages are available on your system, type

     library()

at the R prompt.

   This produces something like

          Packages in `/home/me/lib/R':

          mystuff       My own R functions, nicely packaged but not documented

          Packages in `/usr/local/lib/R/library':

          KernSmooth    Functions for kernel smoothing for Wand & Jones (1995)
          MASS          Main Package of Venables and Ripley's MASS

                        Models
          rpart         Recursive Partitioning
          spatial       Functions for Kriging and Point Pattern Analysis
          splines       Regression Spline Functions and Classes
          stats         The R Stats Package
          stats4        Statistical functions using S4 Classes
          survival      Survival analysis, including penalised likelihood
          tcltk         Tcl/Tk Interface
          tools         Tools for Package Development
          utils         The R Utils Package

   You can "load" the installed package PKG by

     library(PKG)

   You can then find out which functions it provides by typing one of

     library(help = PKG)
     help(package = PKG)

   You can unload the loaded package PKG by

     detach("package:PKG")

5.4 How can add-on packages be removed?
=======================================

Use

     $ R CMD REMOVE PKG_1 ... PKG_N

to remove the packages PKG_1, ..., PKG_N from the library tree rooted at
the first directory given in `R_LIBS' if this is set and non-null, and from
the default library otherwise.  (Versions of R prior to 1.3.0 removed from
the default library by default.)

   To remove from library LIB, do

     $ R CMD REMOVE -l LIB PKG_1 ... PKG_N

5.5 How can I create an R package?
==================================

A package consists of a subdirectory containing the files `DESCRIPTION' and
`INDEX', and the subdirectories `R', `data', `demo', `exec', `inst', `man',
`src', and `tests' (some of which can be missing).  Optionally the package
can also contain script files `configure' and `cleanup' which are executed
before and after installation.

   See section "Creating R packages" in `Writing R Extensions', for
details.  This manual is included in the R distribution, *note What
documentation exists for R?::, and gives information on package structure,
the configure and cleanup mechanisms, and on automated package checking and
building.

   R version 1.3.0 has added the function `package.skeleton()' which will
set up directories, save data and code, and create skeleton help files for
a set of R functions and datasets.

   *Note What is CRAN?::, for information on uploading a package to CRAN.

5.6 How can I contribute to R?
==============================

R is in active development and there is always a risk of bugs creeping in.
Also, the developers do not have access to all possible machines capable of
running R.  So, simply using it and communicating problems is certainly of
great value.

   One place where functionality is still missing is the modeling software
as described in "Statistical Models in S" (see *Note What is S?::); some of
the nonlinear modeling code is not there yet.

   The R Developer Page (http://developer.R-project.org/) acts as an
intermediate repository for more or less finalized ideas and plans for the
R statistical system.  It contains (pointers to) TODO lists, RFCs, various
other writeups, ideas lists, and CVS miscellanea.

   Many (more) of the packages available at the Statlib S Repository might
be worth porting to R.

   If you are interested in working on any of these projects, please notify
Kurt Hornik <Kurt.Hornik@R-project.org>.

6 R and Emacs
*************

6.1 Is there Emacs support for R?
=================================

There is an Emacs package called ESS ("Emacs Speaks Statistics") which
provides a standard interface between statistical programs and statistical
processes.  It is intended to provide assistance for interactive
statistical programming and data analysis.  Languages supported include: S
dialects (R, S 3/4, and S-PLUS 3.x/4.x/5.x/6.x/7.x), LispStat dialects
(XLispStat, ViSta), SAS, Stata, and BUGS.

   ESS grew out of the need for bug fixes and extensions to S-mode 4.8
(which was a GNU Emacs interface to S/S-PLUS version 3 only).  The current
set of developers desired support for XEmacs, R, S4, and MS Windows.  In
addition, with new modes being developed for R, Stata, and SAS, it was felt
that a unifying interface and framework for the user interface would
benefit both the user and the developer, by helping both groups conform to
standard Emacs usage.  The end result is an increase in efficiency for
statistical programming and data analysis, over the usual tools.

   R support contains code for editing R source code (syntactic indentation
and highlighting of source code, partial evaluations of code, loading and
error-checking of code, and source code revision maintenance) and
documentation (syntactic indentation and highlighting of source code,
sending examples to running ESS process, and previewing), interacting with
an inferior R process from within Emacs (command-line editing, searchable
command history, command-line completion of R object and file names, quick
access to object and search lists, transcript recording, and an interface
to the help system), and transcript manipulation (recording and saving
transcript files, manipulating and editing saved transcripts, and
re-evaluating commands from transcript files).

   The latest stable version of ESS are available via CRAN or the ESS web
page (http://ESS.R-project.org/).  The HTML version of the documentation
can be found at `http://stat.ethz.ch/ESS/'.

   ESS comes with detailed installation instructions.

   For help with ESS, send email to <ESS-help@stat.math.ethz.ch>.

   Please send bug reports and suggestions on ESS to
<ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch>.  The easiest way to do this from is within
Emacs by typing `M-x ess-submit-bug-report' or using the [ESS] or [iESS]
pulldown menus.

6.2 Should I run R from within Emacs?
=====================================

Yes, _definitely_.  Inferior R mode provides a readline/history mechanism,
object name completion, and syntax-based highlighting of the interaction
buffer using Font Lock mode, as well as a very convenient interface to the
R help system.

   Of course, it also integrates nicely with the mechanisms for editing R
source using Emacs.  One can write code in one Emacs buffer and send whole
or parts of it for execution to R; this is helpful for both data analysis
and programming.  One can also seamlessly integrate with a revision control
system, in order to maintain a log of changes in your programs and data, as
well as to allow for the retrieval of past versions of the code.

   In addition, it allows you to keep a record of your session, which can
also be used for error recovery through the use of the transcript mode.

   To specify command line arguments for the inferior R process, use `C-u
M-x R' for starting R.

6.3 Debugging R from within Emacs
=================================

To debug R "from within Emacs", there are several possibilities.  To use
the Emacs GUD (Grand Unified Debugger) library with the recommended
debugger GDB, type `M-x gdb' and give the path to the R _binary_ as
argument.  At the `gdb' prompt, set `R_HOME' and other environment
variables as needed (using e.g.  `set env R_HOME /path/to/R/', but see also
below), and start the binary with the desired arguments (e.g., `run
--quiet').

   If you have ESS, you can do `C-u M-x R <RET> - d <SPC> g d b <RET>' to
start an inferior R process with arguments `-d gdb'.

   A third option is to start an inferior R process via ESS (`M-x R') and
then start GUD (`M-x gdb') giving the R binary (using its full path name)
as the program to debug.  Use the program `ps' to find the process number
of the currently running R process then use the `attach' command in gdb to
attach it to that process.  One advantage of this method is that you have
separate `*R*' and `*gud-gdb*' windows.  Within the `*R*' window you have
all the ESS facilities, such as object-name completion, that we know and
love.

   When using GUD mode for debugging from within Emacs, you may find it
most convenient to use the directory with your code in it as the current
working directory and then make a symbolic link from that directory to the
R binary.  That way `.gdbinit' can stay in the directory with the code and
be used to set up the environment and the search paths for the source, e.g.
as follows:

     set env R_HOME /opt/R
     set env R_PAPERSIZE letter
     set env R_PRINTCMD lpr
     dir /opt/R/src/appl
     dir /opt/R/src/main
     dir /opt/R/src/nmath
     dir /opt/R/src/unix

7 R Miscellanea
***************

7.1 How can I set components of a list to NULL?
===============================================

You can use

     x[i] <- list(NULL)

to set component `i' of the list `x' to `NULL', similarly for named
components.  Do not set `x[i]' or `x[[i]]' to `NULL', because this will
remove the corresponding component from the list.

   For dropping the row names of a matrix `x', it may be easier to use
`rownames(x) <- NULL', similarly for column names.

7.2 How can I save my workspace?
================================

`save.image()' saves the objects in the user's `.GlobalEnv' to the file
`.RData' in the R startup directory.  (This is also what happens after
`q("yes")'.)  Using `save.image(FILE)' one can save the image under a
different name.

7.3 How can I clean up my workspace?
====================================

To remove all objects in the currently active environment (typically
`.GlobalEnv'), you can do

     rm(list = ls(all = TRUE))

(Without `all = TRUE', only the objects with names not starting with a `.'
are removed.)

7.4 How can I get eval() and D() to work?
=========================================

Strange things will happen if you use `eval(print(x), envir = e)' or
`D(x^2, "x")'.  The first one will either tell you that "`x'" is not found,
or print the value of the wrong `x'.  The other one will likely return zero
if `x' exists, and an error otherwise.

   This is because in both cases, the first argument is evaluated in the
calling environment first.  The result (which should be an object of mode
`"expression"' or `"call"') is then evaluated or differentiated.  What you
(most likely) really want is obtained by "quoting" the first argument upon
surrounding it with `expression()'.  For example,

     R> D(expression(x^2), "x")
     2 * x

   Although this behavior may initially seem to be rather strange, is
perfectly logical.  The "intuitive" behavior could easily be implemented,
but problems would arise whenever the expression is contained in a
variable, passed as a parameter, or is the result of a function call.
Consider for instance the semantics in cases like

     D2 <- function(e, n) D(D(e, n), n)

or

     g <- function(y) eval(substitute(y), sys.frame(sys.parent(n = 2)))
     g(a * b)

   See the help page for `deriv()' for more examples.

7.5 Why do my matrices lose dimensions?
=======================================

When a matrix with a single row or column is created by a subscripting
operation, e.g., `row <- mat[2, ]', it is by default turned into a vector.
In a similar way if an array with dimension, say, 2 x 3 x 1 x 4 is created
by subscripting it will be coerced into a 2 x 3 x 4 array, losing the
unnecessary dimension.  After much discussion this has been determined to
be a _feature_.

   To prevent this happening, add the option `drop = FALSE' to the
subscripting.  For example,

     rowmatrix <- mat[2, , drop = FALSE]  # creates a row matrix
     colmatrix <- mat[, 2, drop = FALSE]  # creates a column matrix
     a <- b[1, 1, 1, drop = FALSE]        # creates a 1 x 1 x 1 array

   The `drop = FALSE' option should be used defensively when programming.
For example, the statement

     somerows <- mat[index, ]

will return a vector rather than a matrix if `index' happens to have length
1, causing errors later in the code.  It should probably be rewritten as

     somerows <- mat[index, , drop = FALSE]

7.6 How does autoloading work?
==============================

R has a special environment called `.AutoloadEnv'.  Using `autoload(NAME,
PKG)', where NAME and PKG are strings giving the names of an object and the
package containing it, stores some information in this environment.  When R
tries to evaluate NAME, it loads the corresponding package PKG and
reevaluates NAME in the new package's environment.

   Using this mechanism makes R behave as if the package was loaded, but
does not occupy memory (yet).

   See the help page for `autoload()' for a very nice example.

7.7 How should I set options?
=============================

The function `options()' allows setting and examining a variety of global
"options" which affect the way in which R computes and displays its
results.  The variable `.Options' holds the current values of these
options, but should never directly be assigned to unless you want to drive
yourself crazy--simply pretend that it is a "read-only" variable.

   For example, given

     test1 <- function(x = pi, dig = 3) {
       oo <- options(digits = dig); on.exit(options(oo));
       cat(.Options$digits, x, "\n")
     }
     test2 <- function(x = pi, dig = 3) {
       .Options$digits <- dig
       cat(.Options$digits, x, "\n")
     }

we obtain:

     R> test1()
     3 3.14
     R> test2()
     3 3.141593

   What is really used is the _global_ value of `.Options', and using
`options(OPT = VAL)' correctly updates it.  Local copies of `.Options',
either in `.GlobalEnv' or in a function environment (frame), are just
silently disregarded.

7.8 How do file names work in Windows?
======================================

As R uses C-style string handling, `\' is treated as an escape character,
so that for example one can enter a newline as `\n'.  When you really need
a `\', you have to escape it with another `\'.

   Thus, in filenames use something like `"c:\\data\\money.dat"'.  You can
also replace `\' by `/' (`"c:/data/money.dat"').

7.9 Why does plotting give a color allocation error?
====================================================

On an X11 device, plotting sometimes, e.g., when running `demo("image")',
results in "Error: color allocation error".  This is an X problem, and only
indirectly related to R.  It occurs when applications started prior to R
have used all the available colors.  (How many colors are available depends
on the X configuration; sometimes only 256 colors can be used.)

   One application which is notorious for "eating" colors is Netscape.  If
the problem occurs when Netscape is running, try (re)starting it with
either the `-no-install' (to use the default colormap) or the `-install'
(to install a private colormap) option.

   You could also set the `colortype' of `X11()' to `"pseudo.cube"' rather
than the default `"pseudo"'.  See the help page for `X11()' for more
information.

7.10 How do I convert factors to numeric?
=========================================

It may happen that when reading numeric data into R (usually, when reading
in a file), they come in as factors.  If `f' is such a factor object, you
can use

     as.numeric(as.character(f))

to get the numbers back.  More efficient, but harder to remember, is

     as.numeric(levels(f))[as.integer(f)]

   In any case, do not call `as.numeric()' or their likes directly for the
task at hand (as `as.numeric()' or `unclass()' give the internal codes).

7.11 Are Trellis displays implemented in R?
===========================================

The recommended package *lattice* (which is based on another recommended
package, *grid*) provides graphical functionality that is compatible with
most Trellis commands.

   You could also look at `coplot()' and `dotchart()' which might do at
least some of what you want.  Note also that the R version of `pairs()' is
fairly general and provides most of the functionality of `splom()', and
that R's default plot method has an argument `asp' allowing to specify (and
fix against device resizing) the aspect ratio of the plot.

   (Because the word "Trellis" has been claimed as a trademark we do not
use it in R.  The name "lattice" has been chosen for the R equivalent.)

7.12 What are the enclosing and parent environments?
====================================================

Inside a function you may want to access variables in two additional
environments: the one that the function was defined in ("enclosing"), and
the one it was invoked in ("parent").

   If you create a function at the command line or load it in a package its
enclosing environment is the global workspace.  If you define a function
`f()' inside another function `g()' its enclosing environment is the
environment inside `g()'.  The enclosing environment for a function is
fixed when the function is created.  You can find out the enclosing
environment for a function `f()' using `environment(f)'.

   The "parent" environment, on the other hand, is defined when you invoke
a function.  If you invoke `lm()' at the command line its parent
environment is the global workspace, if you invoke it inside a function
`f()' then its parent environment is the environment inside `f()'.  You can
find out the parent environment for an invocation of a function by using
`parent.frame()' or `sys.frame(sys.parent())'.

   So for most user-visible functions the enclosing environment will be the
global workspace, since that is where most functions are defined.  The
parent environment will be wherever the function happens to be called from.
If a function `f()' is defined inside another function `g()' it will
probably be used inside `g()' as well, so its parent environment and
enclosing environment will probably be the same.

   Parent environments are important because things like model formulas
need to be evaluated in the environment the function was called from, since
that's where all the variables will be available.  This relies on the
parent environment being potentially different with each invocation.

   Enclosing environments are important because a function can use
variables in the enclosing environment to share information with other
functions or with other invocations of itself (see the section on lexical
scoping).  This relies on the enclosing environment being the same each
time the function is invoked.  (In C this would be done with static
variables.)

   Scoping _is_ hard.  Looking at examples helps.  It is particularly
instructive to look at examples that work differently in R and S and try to
see why they differ.  One way to describe the scoping differences between R
and S is to say that in S the enclosing environment is _always_ the global
workspace, but in R the enclosing environment is wherever the function was
created.

7.13 How can I substitute into a plot label?
============================================

Often, it is desired to use the value of an R object in a plot label, e.g.,
a title.  This is easily accomplished using `paste()' if the label is a
simple character string, but not always obvious in case the label is an
expression (for refined mathematical annotation).  In such a case, either
use `parse()' on your pasted character string or use `substitute()' on an
expression.  For example, if `ahat' is an estimator of your parameter a of
interest, use

     title(substitute(hat(a) == ahat, list(ahat = ahat)))

(note that it is `==' and not `=').  Sometimes `bquote()' gives a more
compact form, e.g.,

     title(bquote(hat(a) = .(ahat)))

where subexpressions enclosed in `.()' are replaced by their values.

   There are more worked examples in the mailing list achives.

7.14 What are valid names?
==========================

When creating data frames using `data.frame()' or `read.table()', R by
default ensures that the variable names are syntactically valid.  (The
argument `check.names' to these functions controls whether variable names
are checked and adjusted by `make.names()' if needed.)

   To understand what names are "valid", one needs to take into account
that the term "name" is used in several different (but related) ways in the
language:

  1. A _syntactic name_ is a string the parser interprets as this type of
     expression.  It consists of letters, numbers, and the dot and (for
     version of R at least 1.9.0) underscore characters, and starts with
     either a letter or a dot not followed by a number.  Reserved words are
     not syntactic names.

  2. An _object name_ is a string associated with an object that is
     assigned in an expression either by having the object name on the left
     of an assignment operation or as an argument to the `assign()'
     function.  It is usually a syntactic name as well, but can be any
     non-empty string if it is quoted (and it is always quoted in the call
     to `assign()').

  3. An _argument name_ is what appears to the left of the equals sign when
     supplying an argument in a function call (for example, `f(trim=.5)').
     Argument names are also usually syntactic names, but again can be
     anything if they are quoted.

  4. An _element name_ is a string that identifies a piece of an object (a
     component of a list, for example.)  When it is used on the right of
     the `$' operator, it must be a syntactic name, or quoted.  Otherwise,
     element names can be any strings.  (When an object is used as a
     database, as in a call to `eval()' or `attach()', the element names
     become object names.)

  5. Finally, a _file name_ is a string identifying a file in the operating
     system for reading, writing, etc.  It really has nothing much to do
     with names in the language, but it is traditional to call these
     strings file "names".

7.15 Are GAMs implemented in R?
===============================

Package *gam* from CRAN implements all the Generalized Additive Models
(GAM) functionality as described in the GAM chapter of the White Book.  In
particular, it implements backfitting with both local regression and
smoothing splines, and is extendable.  There is a `gam()' function for GAMs
in package *mgcv*, but it is not an exact clone of what is described in the
White Book (no `lo()' for example).  Package *gss* can fit spline-based
GAMs too.  And if you can accept regression splines you can use `glm()'.
For gaussian GAMs you can use `bruto()' from package *mda*.

7.16 Why is the output not printed when I source() a file?
==========================================================

Most R commands do not generate any output. The command

     1+1

computes the value 2 and returns it; the command

     summary(glm(y~x+z, family=binomial))

fits a logistic regression model, computes some summary information and
returns an object of class `"summary.glm"' (*note How should I write
summary methods?::).

   If you type `1+1' or `summary(glm(y~x+z, family=binomial))' at the
command line the returned value is automatically printed (unless it is
`invisible()'), but in other circumstances, such as in a `source()'d file
or inside a function it isn't printed unless you specifically print it.

   To print the value use

     print(1+1)

or

     print(summary(glm(y~x+z, family=binomial)))

instead, or use `source(FILE, echo=TRUE)'.

7.17 Why does outer() behave strangely with my function?
========================================================

As the help for `outer()' indicates, it does not work on arbitrary
functions the way the `apply()' family does.  It requires functions that
are vectorized to work elementwise on arrays.  As you can see by looking at
the code, `outer(x, y, FUN)' creates two large vectors containing every
possible combination of elements of `x' and `y' and then passes this to
`FUN' all at once.  Your function probably cannot handle two large vectors
as parameters.

   If you have a function that cannot handle two vectors but can handle two
scalars, then you can still use `outer()' but you will need to wrap your
function up first, to simulate vectorized behavior.  Suppose your function
is

     foo <- function(x, y, happy) {
       stopifnot(length(x) == 1, length(y) == 1) # scalars only!
       (x + y) * happy
     }

If you define the general function

     wrapper <- function(x, y, my.fun, ...) {
       sapply(seq(along = x), FUN = function(i) my.fun(x[i], y[i], ...))
     }

then you can use `outer()' by writing, e.g.,

     outer(1:4, 1:2, FUN = wrapper, my.fun = foo, happy = 10)

7.18 Why does the output from anova() depend on the order of factors in the model?
==================================================================================

In a model such as `~A+B+A:B', R will report the difference in sums of
squares between the models `~1', `~A', `~A+B' and `~A+B+A:B'.  If the model
were `~B+A+A:B', R would report differences between `~1', `~B', `~A+B', and
`~A+B+A:B' . In the first case the sum of squares for `A' is comparing `~1'
and `~A', in the second case it is comparing `~B' and `~B+A'.  In a
non-orthogonal design (i.e., most unbalanced designs) these comparisons are
(conceptually and numerically) different.

   Some packages report instead the sums of squares based on comparing the
full model to the models with each factor removed one at a time (the famous
`Type III sums of squares' from SAS, for example).  These do not depend on
the order of factors in the model.  The question of which set of sums of
squares is the Right Thing provokes low-level holy wars on R-help from time
to time.

   There is no need to be agitated about the particular sums of squares
that R reports.  You can compute your favorite sums of squares quite
easily.  Any two models can be compared with `anova(MODEL1, MODEL2)', and
`drop1(MODEL1)' will show the sums of squares resulting from dropping
single terms.

7.19 How do I produce PNG graphics in batch mode?
=================================================

Under a Unix-alike, if your installation supports the `type="cairo"' option
to the `png()' device there should be no problems, and the default settings
should just work.  This option is not available for versions of R prior to
2.7.0, or without support for cairo.  From R 2.7.0 `png()' by default uses
the Quartz device on Mac OS X, and that too works in batch mode.

   Earlier versions of the `png()' device uses the X11 driver, which is a
problem in batch mode or for remote operation.  If you have Ghostscript you
can use `bitmap()', which produces a PostScript or PDF file then converts
it to any bitmap format supported by Ghostscript.  On some installations
this produces ugly output, on others it is perfectly satisfactory.  Many
systems now come with Xvfb from X.Org (http://www.x.org/Downloads.html)
(possibly as an optional install), which is an X11 server that does not
require a screen; and there is the *GDD* package from CRAN, which produces
PNG, JPEG and GIF bitmaps without X11.

7.20 How can I get command line editing to work?
================================================

The Unix command-line interface to R can only provide the inbuilt command
line editor which allows recall, editing and re-submission of prior
commands provided that the GNU readline library is available at the time R
is configured for compilation.  Note that the `development' version of
readline including the appropriate headers is needed: users of Linux binary
distributions will need to install packages such as `libreadline-dev'
(Debian) or `readline-devel' (Red Hat).

7.21 How can I turn a string into a variable?
=============================================

If you have

     varname <- c("a", "b", "d")

you can do

     get(varname[1]) + 2

for

     a + 2

or

     assign(varname[1], 2 + 2)

for

     a <- 2 + 2

or

     eval(substitute(lm(y ~ x + variable),
                     list(variable = as.name(varname[1]))

for

     lm(y ~ x + a)

   At least in the first two cases it is often easier to just use a list,
and then you can easily index it by name

     vars <- list(a = 1:10, b = rnorm(100), d = LETTERS)
     vars[["a"]]

without any of this messing about.

7.22 Why do lattice/trellis graphics not work?
==============================================

The most likely reason is that you forgot to tell R to display the graph.
Lattice functions such as `xyplot()' create a graph object, but do not
display it (the same is true of Trellis graphics in S-PLUS).  The `print()'
method for the graph object produces the actual display.  When you use
these functions interactively at the command line, the result is
automatically printed, but in `source()' or inside your own functions you
will need an explicit `print()' statement.

7.23 How can I sort the rows of a data frame?
=============================================

To sort the rows within a data frame, with respect to the values in one or
more of the columns, simply use `order()' (e.g., `DF[order(DF$a,
DF[["b"]]), ]' to sort the data frame `DF' on columns named `a' and `b').

7.24 Why does the help.start() search engine not work?
======================================================

The browser-based search engine in `help.start()' utilizes a Java applet.
In order for this to function properly, a compatible version of Java must
installed on your system and linked to your browser, and both Java _and_
JavaScript need to be enabled in your browser.

   There have been a number of compatibility issues with versions of Java
and of browsers.  For further details please consult section "Enabling
search in HTML help" in `R Installation and Administration'.  This manual is
included in the R distribution, *note What documentation exists for R?::,
and its HTML version is linked from the HTML search page.

7.25 Why did my .Rprofile stop working when I updated R?
========================================================

Did you read the `NEWS' file?  For functions that are not in the *base*
package you need to specify the correct package namespace, since the code
will be run _before_ the packages are loaded.  E.g.,

     ps.options(horizontal = FALSE)
     help.start()

needs to be

     grDevices::ps.options(horizontal = FALSE)
     utils::help.start()

(`graphics::ps.options(horizontal = FALSE)' in R 1.9.x).

7.26 Where have all the methods gone?
=====================================

Many functions, particularly S3 methods, are now hidden in namespaces.
This has the advantage that they cannot be called inadvertently with
arguments of the wrong class, but it makes them harder to view.

   To see the code for an S3 method (e.g., `[.terms') use

     getS3method("[", "terms")

To see the code for an unexported function `foo()' in the namespace of
package `"bar"' use `bar:::foo'.  Don't use these constructions to call
unexported functions in your own code--they are probably unexported for a
reason and may change without warning.

7.27 How can I create rotated axis labels?
==========================================

To rotate axis labels (using base graphics), you need to use `text()',
rather than `mtext()', as the latter does not support `par("srt")'.

     ## Increase bottom margin to make room for rotated labels
     par(mar = c(7, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)
     ## Create plot with no x axis and no x axis label
     plot(1 : 8, xaxt = "n",  xlab = "")
     ## Set up x axis with tick marks alone
     axis(1, labels = FALSE)
     ## Create some text labels
     labels <- paste("Label", 1:8, sep = " ")
     ## Plot x axis labels at default tick marks
     text(1:8, par("usr")[3] - 0.25, srt = 45, adj = 1,
          labels = labels, xpd = TRUE)
     ## Plot x axis label at line 6 (of 7)
     mtext(1, text = "X Axis Label", line = 6)

When plotting the x axis labels, we use `srt = 45' for text rotation angle,
`adj = 1' to place the right end of text at the tick marks, and `xpd =
TRUE' to allow for text outside the plot region.  You can adjust the value
of the `0.25' offset as required to move the axis labels up or down
relative to the x axis.  See `?par' for more information.

   Also see Figure 1 and associated code in Paul Murrell (2003),
"Integrating grid Graphics Output with Base Graphics Output", _R News_,
*3/2*, 7-12.

7.28 Why is read.table() so inefficient?
========================================

By default, `read.table()' needs to read in everything as character data,
and then try to figure out which variables to convert to numerics or
factors.  For a large data set, this takes condiderable amounts of time and
memory.  Performance can substantially be improved by using the
`colClasses' argument to specify the classes to be assumed for the columns
of the table.

7.29 What is the difference between package and library?
========================================================

A "package" is a standardized collection of material extending R, e.g.
providing code, data, or documentation.  A "library" is a place (directory)
where R knows to find packages it can use (i.e., which were "installed").
R is told to use a package (to "load" it and add it to the search path) via
calls to the function `library'.  I.e., `library()' is employed to load a
package from libraries containing packages.

   *Note R Add-On Packages::, for more details.  See also Uwe Ligges (2003),
"R Help Desk: Package Management", _R News_, *3/3*, 37-39.

7.30 I installed a package but the functions are not there
==========================================================

To actually _use_ the package, it needs to be _loaded_ using `library()'.

   See *Note R Add-On Packages:: and *Note What is the difference between
package and library?:: for more information.

7.31 Why doesn't R think these numbers are equal?
=================================================

The only numbers that can be represented exactly in R's numeric type are
integers and fractions whose denominator is a power of 2.  Other numbers
have to be rounded to (typically) 53 binary digits accuracy.  As a result,
two floating point numbers will not reliably be equal unless they have been
computed by the same algorithm, and not always even then.  For example

     R> a <- sqrt(2)
     R> a * a == 2
     [1] FALSE
     R> a * a - 2
     [1] 4.440892e-16

   The function `all.equal()' compares two objects using a numeric
tolerance of `.Machine$double.eps ^ 0.5'.  If you want much greater
accuracy than this you will need to consider error propagation carefully.

   For more information, see e.g. David Goldberg (1991), "What Every
Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic", _ACM
Computing Surveys_, *23/1*, 5-48, also available via
`http://docs.sun.com/source/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html'.

   To quote from "The Elements of Programming Style" by Kernighan and
Plauger:

     _10.0 times 0.1 is hardly ever 1.0_.

7.32 How can I capture or ignore errors in a long simulation?
=============================================================

Use `try()', which returns an object of class `"try-error"' instead of an
error, or preferably `tryCatch()', where the return value can be configured
more flexibly.  For example

     beta[i,] <- tryCatch(coef(lm(formula, data)),
                          error = function(e) rep(NaN, 4))

would return the coefficients if the `lm()' call succeeded and would return
`c(NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN)' if it failed (presumably there are supposed to be 4
coefficients in this example).

7.33 Why are powers of negative numbers wrong?
==============================================

You are probably seeing something like

     R> -2^2
     [1] -4

and misunderstanding the precedence rules for expressions in R.  Write

     R> (-2)^2
     [1] 4

to get the square of -2.

   The precedence rules are documented in `?Syntax', and to see how R
interprets  an expression you can look at the parse tree

     R> as.list(quote(-2^2))
     [[1]]
     `-`

     [[2]]
     2^2

7.34 How can I save the result of each iteration in a loop into a separate file?
================================================================================

One way is to use `paste()' (or `sprintf()') to concatenate a stem filename
and the iteration number while `file.path()' constructs the path.  For
example, to save results into files `result1.rda', ..., `result100.rda' in
the subdirectory `Results' of the current working directory, one can use

     for(i in 1:100) {
       ## Calculations constructing "some_object" ...
       fp <- file.path("Results", paste("result", i, ".rda", sep = ""))
       save(list = "some_object", file = fp)
     }

7.35 Why are p-values not displayed when using lmer()?
======================================================

Doug Bates has kindly provided an extensive response in a post to the
r-help list, which can be reviewed at
`https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2006-May/094765.html'.

7.36 Why are there unwanted lines between polygons in PDF output viewed in Adobe Reader?
========================================================================================

Output from `polygon()' (and other functions calling `polygon()') with the
argument `border=NA' or `border="transparent"' should suppress border lines
between polygons for all graphics devices.

   PDF output from R can be made in many ways, both directly, and through
for example Postscript or Windows Metafiles converted to PDF in external
software. In Adobe Reader, the default setting for line art, such as
polygons, is to smooth, which produces the impression of thin borders.
Adobe Reader does this both for PDF files written by R or through other
software.

   This is irritating, especially when using Adobe Reader for presentation.
The unwanted effect can be removed by turning off smoothing for line art:
use the `Edit | Preferences | Page Display | Smooth line art' menu in Adobe
Reader 7.0.

7.37 Why does backslash behave strangely inside strings?
========================================================

This question most often comes up in relation to file names (see *Note How
do file names work in Windows?::)  but it also happens that people complain
that they cannot seem to put a single `\' character into a text string
unless it happens to be followed by certain other characters.

   To understand this, you have to distinguish between character strings
and _representations_ of character strings.  Mostly, the representation in
R is just the string with a single or double quote at either end, but there
are strings that cannot be represented that way, e.g., strings that
themselves contains the quote character.  So

     > str <- "This \"text\" is quoted"
     > str
     [1] "This \"text\" is quoted"
     > cat(str, "\n")
     This "text" is quoted

The _escape sequences_ `\"' and `\n' represent a double quote and the
newline character respectively. Printing text strings, using `print()' or
by typing the name at the prompt will use the escape sequences too, but the
`cat()' function will display the string as-is. Notice that `"\n"' is a
one-character string, not two; the backslash is not actually in the string,
it is just generated in the printed representation.

     > nchar("\n")
     [1] 1
     > substring("\n", 1, 1)
     [1] "\n"

   So how do you put a backslash in a string? For this, you have to escape
the escape character. I.e., you have to double the backslash.  as in

     > cat("\\n", "\n")
     \n

   Some functions, particularly those involving regular expression
matching, themselves use metacharacters, which may need to be escaped by
the backslash mechanism.  In those cases you may need a _quadruple_
backslash to represent a single literal one.

   In versions of R up to 2.4.1 an unknown escape sequence like `\p' was
quietly interpreted as just `p'.  Current versions of R emit a warning.

8 R Programming
***************

8.1 How should I write summary methods?
=======================================

Suppose you want to provide a summary method for class `"foo"'.  Then
`summary.foo()' should not print anything, but return an object of class
`"summary.foo"', _and_ you should write a method `print.summary.foo()'
which nicely prints the summary information and invisibly returns its
object.  This approach is preferred over having `summary.foo()' print
summary information and return something useful, as sometimes you need to
grab something computed by `summary()' inside a function or similar.  In
such cases you don't want anything printed.

8.2 How can I debug dynamically loaded code?
============================================

Roughly speaking, you need to start R inside the debugger, load the code,
send an interrupt, and then set the required breakpoints.

   See section "Finding entry points in dynamically loaded code" in
`Writing R Extensions'.  This manual is included in the R distribution,
*note What documentation exists for R?::.

8.3 How can I inspect R objects when debugging?
===============================================

The most convenient way is to call `R_PV' from the symbolic debugger.

   See section "Inspecting R objects when debugging" in `Writing R
Extensions'.

8.4 How can I change compilation flags?
=======================================

Suppose you have C code file for dynloading into R, but you want to use `R
CMD SHLIB' with compilation flags other than the default ones (which were
determined when R was built).

   Starting with R 2.1.0, users can provide personal Makevars configuration
files in `$`HOME'/.R' to override the default flags.  See section "Add-on
packages" in `R Installation and Administration'.

   For earlier versions of R, you could change the file
`R_HOME/etc/Makeconf' to reflect your preferences, or (at least for systems
using GNU Make) override them by the environment variable `MAKEFLAGS'.  See
section "Creating shared objects" in `Writing R Extensions'.

8.5 How can I debug S4 methods?
===============================

Use the `trace()' function with argument `signature=' to add calls to the
browser or any other code to the method that will be dispatched for the
corresponding signature.  See `?trace' for details.

9 R Bugs
********

9.1 What is a bug?
==================

If R executes an illegal instruction, or dies with an operating system
error message that indicates a problem in the program (as opposed to
something like "disk full"), then it is certainly a bug.  If you call
`.C()', `.Fortran()', `.External()' or `.Call()' (or `.Internal()')
yourself (or in a function you wrote), you can always crash R by using
wrong argument types (modes).  This is not a bug.

   Taking forever to complete a command can be a bug, but you must make
certain that it was really R's fault.  Some commands simply take a long
time.  If the input was such that you _know_ it should have been processed
quickly, report a bug.  If you don't know whether the command should take a
long time, find out by looking in the manual or by asking for assistance.

   If a command you are familiar with causes an R error message in a case
where its usual definition ought to be reasonable, it is probably a bug.
If a command does the wrong thing, that is a bug.  But be sure you know for
certain what it ought to have done.  If you aren't familiar with the
command, or don't know for certain how the command is supposed to work,
then it might actually be working right.  For example, people sometimes
think there is a bug in R's mathematics because they don't understand how
finite-precision arithmetic works.  Rather than jumping to conclusions,
show the problem to someone who knows for certain.  Unexpected results of
comparison of decimal numbers, for example `0.28 * 100 != 28' or `0.1 + 0.2
!= 0.3', are not a bug.  *Note Why doesn't R think these numbers are
equal?::, for more details.

   Finally, a command's intended definition may not be best for statistical
analysis.  This is a very important sort of problem, but it is also a
matter of judgment.  Also, it is easy to come to such a conclusion out of
ignorance of some of the existing features.  It is probably best not to
complain about such a problem until you have checked the documentation in
the usual ways, feel confident that you understand it, and know for certain
that what you want is not available.  If you are not sure what the command
is supposed to do after a careful reading of the manual this indicates a
bug in the manual.  The manual's job is to make everything clear.  It is
just as important to report documentation bugs as program bugs.  However,
we know that the introductory documentation is seriously inadequate, so you
don't need to report this.

   If the online argument list of a function disagrees with the manual, one
of them must be wrong, so report the bug.

9.2 How to report a bug
=======================

When you decide that there is a bug, it is important to report it and to
report it in a way which is useful.  What is most useful is an exact
description of what commands you type, starting with the shell command to
run R, until the problem happens.  Always include the version of R,
machine, and operating system that you are using; type `version' in R to
print this.

   The most important principle in reporting a bug is to report _facts_,
not hypotheses or categorizations.  It is always easier to report the
facts, but people seem to prefer to strain to posit explanations and report
them instead.  If the explanations are based on guesses about how R is
implemented, they will be useless; others will have to try to figure out
what the facts must have been to lead to such speculations.  Sometimes this
is impossible.  But in any case, it is unnecessary work for the ones trying
to fix the problem.

   For example, suppose that on a data set which you know to be quite large
the command

     R> data.frame(x, y, z, monday, tuesday)

never returns.  Do not report that `data.frame()' fails for large data
sets.  Perhaps it fails when a variable name is a day of the week.  If this
is so then when others got your report they would try out the
`data.frame()' command on a large data set, probably with no day of the
week variable name, and not see any problem.  There is no way in the world
that others could guess that they should try a day of the week variable
name.

   Or perhaps the command fails because the last command you used was a
method for `"["()' that had a bug causing R's internal data structures to
be corrupted and making the `data.frame()' command fail from then on.  This
is why others need to know what other commands you have typed (or read from
your startup file).

   It is very useful to try and find simple examples that produce
apparently the same bug, and somewhat useful to find simple examples that
might be expected to produce the bug but actually do not.  If you want to
debug the problem and find exactly what caused it, that is wonderful.  You
should still report the facts as well as any explanations or solutions.
Please include an example that reproduces the problem, preferably the
simplest one you have found.

   Invoking R with the `--vanilla' option may help in isolating a bug.
This ensures that the site profile and saved data files are not read.

   Before you actually submit a bug report, you should check whether the
bug has already been reported and/or fixed.  First, try the "Search
Existing Reports" facility in the Bug Tracking page at
`http://bugs.R-project.org/'.  Second, consult
`https://svn.R-project.org/R/trunk/NEWS', which records changes that will
appear in the _next_ release of R, including some bug fixes that do not
appear in Bug Tracking.  (Windows users should additionally consult
`https://svn.R-project.org/R/trunk/src/gnuwin32/CHANGES'.)  Third, if
possible try the current r-patched or r-devel version of R.  If a bug has
already been reported or fixed, please do not submit further bug reports on
it.  Finally, check carefully whether the bug is with R, or a contributed
package.  Bug reports on contributed packages should be sent first to the
package maintainer, and only submitted to the R-bugs repository by package
maintainers, mentioning the package in the subject line.

   On Unix systems a bug report can be generated using the function
`bug.report()'.  This automatically includes the version information and
sends the bug to the correct address.  Alternatively the bug report can be
emailed to <R-bugs@R-project.org> or submitted to the Web page at
`http://bugs.R-project.org/'.  Please try including results of
`sessionInfo()' in your bug report.

   There is a section of the bug repository for suggestions for
enhancements for R labelled `wishlist'.  Suggestions can be submitted in
the same ways as bugs, but please ensure that the subject line makes clear
that this is for the wishlist and not a bug report, for example by starting
with `Wishlist:'.

   Comments on and suggestions for the Windows port of R should be sent to
<R-windows@R-project.org>.

   Corrections to and comments on message translation should be sent to the
last translator (listed at the top of the appropriate `.po' file) or to the
translation team as listed at
`http://developer.R-project.org/TranslationTeams.html'.
